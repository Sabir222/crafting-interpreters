# Crafting Interpreters Practice Repository

## Project Overview

This repository contains my personal implementation and practice exercises while working through the book "Crafting Interpreters" by Robert Nystrom. The goal is to understand programming language implementation, interpreter design, and compiler construction by building my own interpreter.

## Book Reference

- **Book**: Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom
- **Official Website**: [https://craftinginterpreters.com/](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)

## Project Stages

- [x] Chapter 1-3: Introduction and Understanding Language Implementation
- [ ] Tree-Walk Interpreter (Lox Language)
- [ ] Bytecode Virtual Machine
- [ ] Additional Challenges and Extensions

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: (Specify the language you're using, e.g., Java, C, Rust)
- Development Environment: (Your preferred IDE or text editor)

## Learning Objectives

- Understand language design principles
- Learn interpreter and compiler construction techniques
- Practice low-level programming concepts
- Explore runtime and memory management

## Progress Tracking

- [ ] Lexical Analysis (Scanning)
- [ ] Parsing
- [ ] Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- [ ] Evaluation
- [ ] Error Handling
- [ ] Performance Optimizations
